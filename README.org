* About
 This file adds a command called "post-to-textsnip".  When invoked, it will
 post text to textsnip.com for simple/formatted sharing.  If invoked with an
 active region, it will use the text within that region, else it will use the
 entirety of the text within the current buffer.  The resulting url from
 textsnip will then be placed in the kill-ring, as well as the os clipboard
 where applicable.  If the current major mode is listed in
 textsnip/mode-alist, the url will be ammended with the corresponding
 textsnip mode for convenience (saves a mouse click or two).
